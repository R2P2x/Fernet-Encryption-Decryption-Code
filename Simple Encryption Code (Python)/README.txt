important to know: when testing i recommend testing it via terminal so you can easily see the changes being made on the test files.

this is a simple encryption-decryption code using Fernet from cryptography.

you can modify it as much as you want.

its fun to play around with, ive also put 3 test files so you can see what the virus.py does.

please do not use anything you learn from this code or this code itself for malicious purposes, this is for educational purposes only, sure you can troll people as long as you have permission of the person you are trolling
